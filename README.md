## Todo App

A simple checklist/todo app.
It uses json-server for the back end. And vue on the front end.
Bootstrap is used to build out the interface.

I decided not to use the router just to keep it simple.
In hind sight to further improve the app this is a critical piece of the puzzle.

##### Run the project

-   npm install.
-   npm run serve.
-   npm run json-server.

##### To Do

-   Implement a user account functionality.
-   Refactor to use the router.
-   Write more tests.
-   Switch to mongo or something of that sort.
-   Refactor this to be a stand alone component/view.
-   accessibility labels, nav, focus trap etc
